## Project
This project is intended to provide a minimalistic, but customized version of NeoVim. It also serves as a learning experience, and introduction to managing a Github project.

SiVim:
 - **IDE Like**. Sivim has been customized to perform similarly to an IDE, like VsCode.
 - **Configurability**. SiVim has been deliberately written in Vim-Script for people new to programming. The goal was to make syntax easy to read, and manipulate with numerous comments to direct the user.
 - **Minimalistic**. Simplicity is a main factor in SiVim, with it having only 12 plugins, and 5 themes.

## Features
 - Simple installation
 - Eloquent navigation
 - Easy on the eyes
 - Blazing fast multi-buffer toggling
 - Syntax highlighting with treesitter
 - Speed oriented custom keybindings
